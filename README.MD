##Race condition exploit

### Simple tool that helps finding a race exploit in a web application

A tool that performs multiple queries to a web application concurently and saves the results to a file. The output is then parsed, and the requests are saved in two files: desirable output and undesired output. Check if the desired status code is returned for several queries to see if the race exploit was successful.

## Usage

### Go build 
Build by using `go build` and then run the binary with the following arguments:
- `-url` - url to exploit
- `-payload` - Payload to use
- `-headers` - Headers to use; delimited by comma
- `-method` - Method to use | POST, PUT, DELETE
- `-status` - Desired status code
- `-requestno` - Number of requests to send
- `-console` - Print to console (default false)

### Makefile
Cross compile by using the Makefile by running `make build`. This will create a binary for Linux, Windows and MacOS.
Use `make clean` to remove the binaries.

### Docker build 
Build your own docker image by using `docker build -t raceexploit .` and then run the docker image with the CLI arguments.


## Example

`./racecondition -url http://localhost:8080 -payload '{"name":"test"}' -headers "Content-Type:application/json" -method POST -status 201 -requestno 20 -console`

## Output example 
```json
{
    "0": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:8080",
        "Payload": "",
        "Method": "POST",
        "Headers": {
            "Header1": [
                "headerInput"
            ],
            "Header2": [
                "headerInput"
            ]
        },
        "ResponseBody": "example",
        "ResponseStatus": 201,
        "ResponseTime": "127.588584ms"
    },
    "1": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:8080",
        "Payload": "",
        "Method": "POST",
        "Headers": {
            "Header1": [
                "headerInput"
            ],
            "Header2": [
                "headerInput"
            ]
        },
        "ResponseBody": "example",
        "ResponseStatus": 201,
        "ResponseTime": "127.8995ms"
    }
}```
